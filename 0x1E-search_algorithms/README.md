# Search Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms are designed to efficiently search for specific elements in an array or list of data.

## Algorithms Included

1. Linear Search: The linear search algorithm sequentially checks each element in an array or list until a match is found or the entire array has been searched.

2. Binary Search: The binary search algorithm works on sorted arrays or lists. It repeatedly divides the search space in half and compares the target value with the middle element. Based on the comparison, it eliminates the half in which the target value cannot reside. This process continues until the target value is found or the search space is empty.

3. Depth-First Search (DFS): The depth-first search algorithm is used to traverse or search tree or graph structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented recursively or using a stack.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS): The breadth-first search algorithm is another technique to traverse or search tree or graph structures. It explores all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level. It can be implemented using a queue.

## Getting Started

To use these search algorithms in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code files.

2. Include the desired search algorithm implementation file in your project.

3. Use the provided function(s) to perform the search on your data.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of using the binary search algorithm:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "binary_search.h"

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int target = 10;

    int index = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, target);

    if (index != -1) {
        printf("Element found at index %d\n", index);
    } else {
        printf("Element not found\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
